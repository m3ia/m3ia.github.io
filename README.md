**Guess That Number** is a project that I built off of HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. The app will "choose" a number at random, and the user guesses what number it is after choosing their difficulty option. This game is fun to practice binary search with.

One thing I focused on here was making the game accessible to those with visual disabilities (such as color blindness), physical impairments (such as tremors), or dyslexia.

Play the Number Game I developed [here](https://m3ia.github.io/game-project/)!
